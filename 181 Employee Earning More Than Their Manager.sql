SELECT emp1.name AS Employee

# This is an example of self join where the same employee table are join on condition with manager id and employee id to get the details of the manager as well and then salary of employee is checked with the salary of the manager.

#OR

SELECT name AS Employee
FROM Employee
WHERE salary > (
    SELECT salary 
    FROM Employee 
    WHERE id = Employee.managerId
);

#The query selects employees whose salary is higher than their manager's. It uses a subquery to fetch the manager's salary based on the managerId and compares it with the employeeâ€™s salary. Proper indexing on id and managerId ensures better performance.
